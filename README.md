# A Stronger Nation data

In the process of creating the charts and graphs for the *A Stronger Nation* apps, we decided it would be much easier to work with this data (originally in Excel files) if it were in a friendlier format (for programming). Since we like JSON, we serialized it (with the help of [@shancarter](http://www.twitter.com/shancarter)'s [Mr. Data Converter](https://github.com/shancarter/Mr-Data-Converter)).

We are also including the original Excel files in this repo so that we might have a more structured way of editing them from here on out.

## The project

For those unfamiliar with this project, what you have here is a bunch of national/state/county data on education (check out the "meta" properties in [data.json](https://github.com/irong8/stronger-nation-data/blob/master/data.json) for the sources). The data was compiled for a project entitled [*A Stronger Nation Through Higher Education*](http://www.luminafoundation.org/state_work.html); put together by [Lumina Foundation](http://www.luminafoundation.org/).

## Parting words

This is not our data. It is compiled by the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/), and was assembled/organized for Lumina Foundation by [NCHEMS](http://www.nchems.org/). All we have done is pull it together for the purpose of our project. Feel free to sift through it, take what you want, or clone till your hearts content. Just make sure to acknowledge the U.S. Census Bureau.
